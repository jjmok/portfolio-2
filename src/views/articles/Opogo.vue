    <h1 class="display-3">Improving the Job Search Experience for Supply Teachers</h1>
    <p>October 2020 - December 2020</p>

    <h2 class="display-4">Overview</h2>

    <p>In October 2020, I've joined an online UI/UX class organized by <a target=”_blank” href="https://experiencehaus.com/">Experience Haus</a> in the UK. As part of the course, I was provided the opportunity to work together with a real client, Opogo. They are a Social Enterprise that brings together technology and expertise to help support educators and schools.</p>

    <p>There are 12 participants and we are grouped into 4 teams. Each team will be carrying out their research and proposing their solutions</p>

    <h2 class="h4">A brief look at UK's education sector</h2>

    <blockquote class="blockquote bg-primary text-white p-4 italic">
      <em>"81% of educators are considering leaving the profession in the previous 12 months because of workload pressures"</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There is a very high demand for teachers in the UK and there are various recruitment agencies that serve to fill this gap. However, hiring teachers can be a very costly matter. Some schools had reportedly paid up to £11,000 in finder's fees to recruit teachers, making the hiring process very costly for both schools and educators. </p>

    <p>Teacher retention was poor. Educators had been leaving the profession due to workload pressure and a stressful working environment. At the time of writing, this situation had been exacerbated by the 2020 COVID pandemic. Overseas teachers can't travel abroad and this leads to a drop in potential teachers.</p>

    <p> Opogo is among one of the education platforms out there which aims not only to help schools save costs but to also find solutions to improve retention</p>
    
    <h2 class="h4">Users and Audience</h2>
    <p>Opogo's main user base is supply teachers and schools. While teachers use the Opogo app on mobile to look for jobs, the schools play a more active role in looking for teachers via the Desktop app.</p> 

    <p>Teachers firstly go through a compliance process in which they upload their credentials to be verified by the Opogo team. Verified teachers will be able to pick the time and date they are available for work and also set the distance they can travel. On the other end, Cover Managers will be able to scout, hire and manage their talents all on their talent pool in the desktop app.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, Opogo also has a thriving community of teachers who shares their learning and inspire each other. </p>

    <h2 class="h4">The Design Challenge</h2>
    
    <p>Opogo was interested in improving the user experience for their current app before developing the platform further. In the provided design brief, we were required to review the following flows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The onboarding flow for a new teacher when they sign up in the Opogo App</li>
      <li>the daily supply booking flow for the School Platform & the Opogo App </li>
    </ul>

    <p> While these are the main requests, we'll also be looking to point out other potential areas of improvement. We approach this challenge with the guidance of the Double Diamond Process</p>

    <h2 class="h4">My role in this Project</h2>
    <p>In this course, I work together with another 2 students from different backgrounds. We conducted our interviews and research together to form the 3 problem statements. Each of us picked one of the issues to work on individually, and finally presenting all 3 solutions in a single flow.</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Scope and Constraints</h2>
    <p> As this is a learning course, there's a lack of time to go through every process thoroughly and this leads to several outcomes: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Over the 8-week course, we can only interview 6 users. Hence the personas are formed from a small set of data and might not be a fully accurate presentation of Opogo Users.</li>
      <li>The solution we provided is designed mainly with one persona in mind.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="display-4">Discover</h2>

    <h2 class="h4">Stakeholder Interview</h2>
    <p>Firstly, we had an interview with Opogo's CEO, Justyn. This interview yielded several insights that are helpful for us to get started on the project:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Opogo's solution is geared towards a social cause that is by investing their profits back into retention & creating a social impact through community.</li>
      <li>They are looking at building up a talent pool and creating a more engaging community among educators.</li>
      <li>Online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Linkedin are considered to be either be too hostile or too generic for discussions. This drives the need to create a safe space for teachers to share and learn through the community. </li>
      <li>The current compliance process teachers went through to get verified can get unwieldy and it doesn't feel like a two-click process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h4">Competitors</h2>
    <p>Opogo is not the only app out there that's trying to tackle this issue. Apps such as Zen Educate, Engage Education, SickCover were also competing in the same field. While these aforementioned apps shared certain similarities with Opogo. We are more interested in what sets them apart</p>

    <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/competitive-research.jpg" alt="competitive-research">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Engage Education</strong> - iDay provides overseas teachers and all-expenses-paid week-long trips where you get to meet and interview with multiple schools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supply Clouds</strong> - Gamification - Teachers can earn points and badges which can be used to claim prizes. This
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Teacherise</strong> - Feedback Loop - Teachers can provide feedback about the school and teaching experience
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>While not all of these are applicable suggestions for Opogo as they have a different mission, it nonetheless does provides ideas on how Opogo can expand their services</p>

    <h2 class="display-4">Define</h2>
    <p>During this phase, we were introduced to various UX processes, each of them serves a specific need and we were encouraged to try all of them out to learn and explore what each tool does best.</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Forming Personas - Formulating Questions</h2>
    <p>Opogo has developed its own set of user personas but it has been a while since it was updated. We started off our research by asking scoped questions to get details on specific areas. This includes the teacher's background, struggles, motivations, and how we can help them. Examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Can you tell me more about your work as a teacher? How long have you been working?</li>
      <li>Tell me about the last time you tried to look for a role in education?</li>
      <li>How does the recent pandemic affect your line of work and your livelihood?</li>
      <li>Have you used any other recruitment agencies? How have you found them compared to Opogo?</li>
      <li>What motivates you to become a teacher?</li>
      <li>What struggles do you faced when you are using the Opogo app?</li>
      <li>What do you think Opogo can improve on?</li>
      <li>Do you have a form of community where you can upskill and discuss topics? </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In one of our classes, we held our first user interview with 2 Opogo users. They were interviewed by 2 students in our class while we take notes. Apart from that, Our team also conducted our interviews with a few more teachers to form a better picture of our user personas.</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Forming Personas</h2>
    <div class="d-flex">
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-500 mr-3" src="@/assets/img/personas.png" alt="personas">
      <p>For each interviewee, we present their feedbacks in the structure shown on the image. With more information gathered from different interviewees, we'll be able to see trends or common behaviors that will help us to form our Personas</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="h4">Forming Personas - Empathy Maps</h2>
    <div class="d-flex">
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-500 mr-3" src="@/assets/img/empathy-map.png" alt="empathy-map">
      <div>
        <p>
          We also created an empathy map that puts ourselves in the shoes of the teachers
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach makes us think about the possible experiences of a supply teacher. Giving us insights on how we could design solutions that are tailored to their needs
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      More examples can be found in this <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/experiencehaus6726/m/experiencehaus6726/1605303599763/251f08f544e2ba9943056dc2ac117293a80e4290">Mural Link</a>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h4">Forming Personas - the 3 personas</h2>

    <p>The previous maps paint a common behavioral pattern among our interviewees, and this leads to the formulation of 3 personas.</p>

    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-700 mb-2" src="@/assets/img/persona1.jpg" alt="persona1">
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-700 mb-2" src="@/assets/img/persona2.jpg" alt="persona2">
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-700 mb-2" src="@/assets/img/persona3.jpg" alt="persona3">
    </div>

    <p>Due to the interest of time, we decided to form our solution based on 1 persona: The Rep for Temps AKA the temporary supply teacher.</p>
    
    <p>As opposed to a permanent teacher, temporary supplies are teachers whom are generally on the move. They valued the flexibility offered by a temporary position. During this short stint before they relocate, they are looking for a temporary role to fill in to get more income. Retirees whom are interested in part time roles as an educator also fits into this group.</p>

    <h2 class="h4">User Journey - Task Analysis</h2>
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      <p>
        Next, we took a deeper look into the journey of our persona and how she goes through a journey to look for a job to gain a better understanding of the flow that she went through. This approach focuses more on the tasks that a teacher might do at a specific stage of their journey.
      </p>
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/task-analysis.png" alt="task-analysis">
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="h4">User Journey - Experience Map</h2>
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      <p>
        Apart from that, we also tried another approach to understand our persona's journey better. This method explores the user journey on a more empathetic level.
      </p>
      <p>From this map work, the low point that stood out to us was the last one: supply teachers feels anxious on their first day to school.</p>
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/experience-map.png" alt="experience-map">
    </div>
  
    <h2>User Stories</h2>
    
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      <p>Based on experience maps and our user interviews, we started to form user stories. Each of them focuses on a problem our persona is trying to solve and when do they need it solved. </p>
      <p>It's generally framed in the following method:</p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote bg-primary text-white p-4 italic">
        As a _(user)_, I would like to __ (action)___ so that I can __ (what is success?)___.
      </blockquote>
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/user-stories.png" alt="user-stories">
    </div>

    <h2>Job Stories</h2>
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      <p> We tried another approach using the Jobs-to-be-done framework. Instead of focusing on the User Personas, this prompts us to think about what motivates teachers to use Opogo in the first place. How does it enable our teachers to perform their jobs?</p>
      <p>It's framed as the following:</p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote bg-primary text-white p-4 italic">
        When __(trigger) __ , I want to __ (action)___ , so I can __ (success criteria)___
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/job-stories.png" alt="job-stories">
    </div>
    
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p> From the research, we decided to look into these 3 areas:</p>

    <h5 class="text-info">School needs to spend more time to look for supplies teacher with the right qualifications
    </h5>
    <blockquote>
      "If you're employing a secondary school teacher, you need to know what subjects they have taught and which top subjects they've specialised in."
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In Opogo's case, teachers sign up to the Opogo Platform and go through the compliance process, the schools cover managers would employ teachers with the expertise they seek. However, there's no fast way to look for teacher with a specific set of qualifications on the Opogo App.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-success">Supply Teachers travelling to new school feels anxious because there’s a lack of first day orientation
    </h5>

    <blockquote>
      “I always like to go to a school and feel like somewhat prepared, or know what I’m getting myself into.”
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “I had no idea where I was going. I didn’t even know where to put my bag.””
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Due to the spontaneous nature of the job, supply teachers are sometimes called in to work on the morning without much notice. Teachers feels anxious on their first visit to a new school because there's a lack of information regarding these schools.</li>
      <li>
        On the Opogo app, Information regarding point of contact wasn't kept updated and there's overall lack of orientation for teachers on their first day.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-warning">Supply teachers often feel left out of the loop and isolated due to the lack of an active community that keeps them engaged
    </h5>
    <blockquote>
      “I can’t find an obvious place within the app, to post and speak to people.”
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Opogo has its own community platform and it mainly provides the outlet for teachers to share their learnings. Teachers often feel left out of the loop as there's no motivation to keep them engaged.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- <div>
      <h5>Misc Problems</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Opogo app needs a way to check up on long-term supply teachers to see how they are getting on at the schools. This will therefore retain these teachers on the Opogo app.</li>
        <li>The Opogo website needs to be much more discoverable on the search engine when we search for supply teacher because a lot of teachers looking for a role in supply teaching won't discover it</li>
        <li>Opogo needs a way to be more accommodating to teachers who don't know the London area because people who have just arrived in the city  will feel disorientated and will not know the different areas.</li>
        <li>The Opogo app needs to show teachers feedbacks from their students because teachers aren't sure how well they are performing</li>
      </ul>
    </div> -->


    <hr>

    <h2 class="display-4">Develop</h2>
    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>From the problems above, we have formed 3 hypothesis: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong class="text-info">Search Specialization</strong> — We believe that by expanding the job search filters, for both teachers and school, we will display better matches for both parties but also increase the level of confidence in the platform, we will know this to be true when we see more compatible matches and an increase of the number of bookings</li>
      <li><strong class="text-success">School Communication</strong> — We believe that by allowing teachers and schools to share essential information before the teacher arrives. Teachers will feel much supported when they arrived at the school on their first day. We will know this to be true when we get positive feedback from teachers in regards to orientation at new schools </li>
      <li><strong class="text-warning">Community</strong> — We believe that by allowing teachers to connect directly with each other through (method), we will create a more engaged and supportive community, We will know this to be true when we see consistent growth in the Monthly Active User</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Ideation & Storyboarding</h2>
    <p>In the ideation phase, we explore possible solutions to our problem statement. The solutions at this points are meant to be fast, exploratory, and not constraint by limitations.</p>

    <div class="d-flex">
      <div class="mr-5">
        <h5>School Communication (Storyboard)</h5>
        <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-500" src="@/assets/img/school-communication.jpeg" alt="school-communication">
      </div>
  
      <div class="mr-5">
        <h5>Search Filter (Ideation)</h5>
        <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-500" src="@/assets/img/search-filter.jpeg" alt="search-filter">
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h5>Community (Ideation)</h5>
        <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-500" src="@/assets/img/community.jpeg" alt="community">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>After this stage ends, each of us chose one solution to focus on before merging our solutions back into one flow. I've decided to work on the search specialization issue </p>
    <hr>

    <h2 class="display-4">Deliver</h2>
    <h5>User Flow</h5>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-9">
        <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/user-flow-1.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="col-3">
        <p>I went through several variations before settling for this flow. Due to our time constraints, I kept the user flow straightforward and within our capabilities to develop.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      
      <!-- <div class="col">
        <p>Mobile App - Teachers looking for Schools</p>
        <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/user-flow-2.png" alt="">
      </div> -->

    <h5>Low Fidelity</h5>
    <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/low-fidelity-desktop.png" alt="low-fidelity-desktop">
    <!-- <img class="border rounded img-fluid " src="@/assets/img/low-fidelity-mobile.png" alt="low-fidelity-mobile"> -->
    <p>The low fidelity wireframes are created in Figma to visualize the process of looking for a teacher. Most of the details aren't refined and it's focused on building out the important interactive components. A digital prototype was created based on this screen next to get feedback from a usability test </p>

    <h5>Usability Test</h5>
    <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/prototype.png" alt="prototype">

    <p>The main goal of this test is to identify any usability issues that this prototype might have. It's also within my interest to find out if our users had any other expectations or needs. </p>
    <p>Our participants are asked to put themselves in the role of a cover manager. They are tasked to find a temporary daily supply teacher to cover for them with the provided prototype</p>
    <p>They are encouraged to speak their thoughts out loud and are reminded that there are no right and wrong answers as we are testing the app, and not them. Refer to this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/vbqZO7PzMR5a8jWP6SKHOH/Experience-Haus-Team-4?node-id=119%3A19608&viewport=1094%2C523%2C0.2052823305130005&scaling=contain">link</a> for more information of the prototype</p>

    <h5>Usability Feedback</h5>
    <p>The feedback that I have received were generally positive but there's one issue that stood out. </p>

    <p>In my design, adding more tags would lead to more talents being shown. For example, if there are two qualification tags in the search bar, "Autism" and "KS1". The system would display all teachers that had one these qualifications or with both of them. (Right Image) </p>
    
    <p>The participant expects the system to ONLY display teachers that has these two qualifications (Left Image), as its meant to filter out teachers that has these two criterias and not show every possible results</p>

    <img class="col-12" src="@/assets/img/expectation.png" alt="expectations">

    <h2>Hi-Fidelity Mockup</h2>
    <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/hi-fidelity-mockup.png" alt="hi-fidelity-mockup">
    
    <p>Finally, this lead to the <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/vbqZO7PzMR5a8jWP6SKHOH/Experience-Haus-Team-4?node-id=366%3A20969&viewport=-318%2C272%2C0.06906378269195557&scaling=contain">high-fidelity mockup</a>.</p>
    <p>This design follows conventional tag searchbar designs so as not to throw any users off with something they are unfamiliar with. </p>

    <p>Following the the brand guidelines that Opogo has provided us, I have made a few UI changes apart from creating the searchbar.</p>
    
    <img class="rounded img-fluid img-500" src="@/assets/img/teacher-card.png" alt="teacher-card">
    <ul>
      <li>Teachers are also tag as <strong>Daily Supply</strong>, <strong>Long Term Supply</strong>, or <strong>Permanent</strong>. As these are recurring tags that are seen throughout each card, I've proposed replacing the tags with icons to create more space for other components. These icons would also have tooltips to show managers what they represent.</li>
      <li>The tags are separated into 3 colors for readability: blue for age group, grey for subject, and light green for special needs qualifications</li>
      <li>The teacher's details that was displayed at the bottom of each card in the original design is hidden in the proposed design. This is to keep the user's attention on teacher's qualification. They can read the more details by clicking into the card. </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Original Design</h5>
    <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="@/assets/img/opogo-talent.png" alt="opogo-talent">

    <p>The proposed solution doesn't require major UI overhaul. It's a low cost approach to display better matches for both school and teachers, which can leads to increase active users.</p>
